Note: some of the documents that Vlad states are lost, especially CFJs, have indeed survived. In particular, the first 61 CFJs are in the CFJ archive. Some of these documents reveal minor errors in Vlad's summary (such as listing the Judge of a CFJ as the submitter or vice versa), but Vlad's work still gives an effective picture of early Agora. -- Elysion

Therefore, the players above could have joined any time during the Voting Period of Props 301-3 (i.e., July 1-8), and the date a Player leaves can only be approximated. Also note I was not 100% diligent in listing Players joining or (especially) leaving, so the list is probably incomplete.]</td>

<td colspan="5">[The contents of CFJs 10-12 clearly suggest a game had just ended. Since the questions are pretty basic, it stands to reason (also given the date) that the end of the first Game of Agora occurred shortly before Aug. 16. New info from Michael Norrish reveals that the winner was Wes, that he won when Oerjan agreed to trade Wes 58 points in exchange for voting FOR Proposal 361, giving Wes 109 points, over the 100 point win threshhold. Thus the game ended some time after August 8\. Since Michael indicated that Props 360-372 were still up for vote, we can further refine the date to between August 11 (when Props 371-2 were submitted, according to the reasoning stated above), and August 16.]</td>
