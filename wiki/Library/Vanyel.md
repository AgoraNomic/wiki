<STRONG>Pragmatism and Platonism: Two Approaches to Nomic</STRONG>
</P><P ALIGN="CENTER">
by Don &quot;Vanyel&quot; Blaheta
</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">
	Any Nomic Rule has multiple interpretations.  This is, perhaps
unfortunately, a fact of life for any Nomicker; given any Rule there is
almost guaranteed to be some disagreement over its meaning.  The most
common source of debate seems to lie in the dichotomy between Platonist
and Pragmatist interpretations.  In the former case it may be assumed
that if a Rule says an event shall occur, and doesn&#39;t, play can continue
*as if* the event had happened as specified.  In the Pragmatist view,
however, any event which occurs late or not at all, or not as specified
in the Rules, can not be retroactively &quot;fixed&quot;--one may only take the
game state as it is at the time, and try to work with what is there.
</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">
	This dichotomy shows up in many games, and is dealt with in
different ways.  In recent discussion on the Agora Nomic discussion
listserver the examples of Bridge and Chess were brought up to exemplify
the application of the two viewpoints.  Bridge is largely a Pragmatic
game; although Players are not *supposed* to see any other Player&#39;s cards
but their own (and the Dummy), occasionally it will happen that a Player
will glimpse someone else&#39;s hand, and there are several rules to deal with
this.  On the other hand, in Chess if a Player accidentally puts a piece
in the wrong square, or knocks one off the board, it is replaced as if
it had never happened.
</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">
	It would probably be easier to deal with the dichotomy if it
were explicitly dealt with in the Nomic Ruleset, but unfortunately all
attempts to make the Agora Rules explicitly Pragmatic or Platonic have
failed due to technicality, scam, or public dissent.  For example, at
one point during the history of Agora Nomic there was such a thing as a
&quot;Crime&quot;, of varying degrees between A and D.  Each type of Crime had its
own penalty, and many Rules specified a certain transgression to be a type
of Crime.  This system seemed to work, except that a number of Rules which
*should* have remained Platonic were only ambiguously so, and the Rules
intended to be Pragmatic (by instituting the Crimes) were phrased such
that the Crime only occurred if &quot;this Rule is broken&quot;, which could not
happen because of Rule 101: &quot;All Players must follow the Rules.&quot;  In
addition, much of this Criminal Justice system was lost in the Grey
Repeals of October 1994 before it could be fixed.
</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">
	It should be clear that both types should be required; if a Speaker
happens to mispublish the results of a Vote, Platonism should clearly be
applied to treat the Game State *as if* e had published the correct Results.
On the other hand, if it is discovered that a Player thought to have been
deregistered for months really wasn&#39;t (due to some technicality), it would
be nigh impossible to return through months of Reports and Results to
recalculate Quorums, Taxes, Passed and Failed Rules, etc.  So the desirable
treatment would be to continue Play as it has been; with this Player 
deregistered as reported several months before.
</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">
	In spite of this, it appears difficult to modify a Nomic already
in progress to account for the two viewpoints.  Thus, I have developed a
new Initial Nomic Ruleset to use the Pragmatic and Platonic philosophies.
It is, of course, heavily based on Peter Suber&#39;s original Rules, with 
a few important modifications: I have made two basic categories of Rules,
Pragmatic and Platonic, which each has its own subdivisions.  Within the
Pragmatic Order are Classes based on the importance of the Rule.  These
Classes are numbered beginning at 1 for the least significant Rules.  The
Classes of the Pragmatic Order serve several purposes: the higher Classes
are harder to modify, have higher precedence (if a Rules in a lower Class
conflicts it automatically defers to the Rule in the higher Class), and
carry a greater penalty.  Within the Platonic Order the divisions are
similar, but not quite identical.  There is a Class of the Platonic Order
known as Meta Rules, which are Rules which are so phenomenally important
to the game that they take precedence over all other Rules of either Order.
Other than this Class there are numbered Classes as with the Pragmatics,
which establish precedence and difficulty of modification.  (Since, however,
they may not be broken, no penalties are assigned.)
</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">
	The method with which I assigned one of the Initial Rules to one
Order or the other is fairly easily defined: Platonic Rules are Rules which
are primarily dealing exclusively with Game Entities.  Occasionally there
is a Platonic which deals somewhat with the practical or real-world side
of Nomic, but these Rules are of the type which shouldn&#39;t be broken, and
if they are broken should be fixed and treated as if they weren&#39;t.  On the
other hand, the Pragmatics often deal with the real-world representation
of the game.  These are &quot;prescriptive&quot; rather than &quot;descriptive&quot; laws, and
as such may be broken--but with a penalty.
</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">
	Of course, given the vastly different types of Nomic in existence,
it would have been impossible to write a tailor-made Ruleset for each; to
my knowledge, there have been Nomics run via email, UNIX notesfiles, WWW,
and the Usenet in addition to face-to-face games.  However, since Nomic was
originally designed as a face-to-face game, I have designed my Ruleset 
around that specification.  Users of other types of Nomic may enjoy the
challenge of converting this Ruleset to their home format.
</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">
	As a minor sidenote, I will add that I have fixed a few minor
problems with Suber&#39;s original Ruleset.  I can hardly claim that his Ruleset
was flawed in a major way, but I&#39;m sure nobody could have anticipated the
rigours which Agora and others have put the system through; among other
corrections, I fixed the distinction between Proposals and Rule Changes,
adjusted Amendment to a more playable meaning, and assigned more levels of
&quot;Mutability&quot; as it was called in the Original; here it is called &quot;Class&quot;,
of which there are five, as opposed to the original two.
</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">
	I will also add that my Ruleset can hardly be perfect.  I harbor
no doubts that a rigorous playtest would uncover many little problems
with my version, much as current Nomics are discovering problems with 
Suber&#39;s original.

Rule 101--Platonic (Meta)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      Each Rule lies within one of two Orders--Platonic or Pragmatic.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      Rules which are Platonic are descriptive in nature; they describe
      the way the Game State is.  In the event that the recorded Game
      State (as transcribed in the Ruleset or any list of scores, or
      indeed any physical manifestation of the game) does not agree
      with this Platonic Game State, the Platonic Game State is correct.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      Rules which are Pragmatic are prescriptive; they prescribe to the
      Players how they must conduct themselves through the Game, as well
      as controlling physical manifestations of the Game.  If for some
      reason an Entity under the control of the Game does not follow
      these Pragmatic Rules, he, she, or it is liable for this error.
      Other Rules may specify a Penalty for such transgressions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      Of the Rules in the Initial Set, Rules 101-123 are Platonic and
      201-209 are Pragmatic, initially.  These may change as according
      to the Rules once play has begun.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">
Rule 102--Platonic (Meta)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      A Player always has the option to leave the game rather than 
      continue to play or incur a game penalty.  No penalty worse
      than losing, in the judgement of the player to incur it, may
      be imposed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Rule 103--Platonic (Meta)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      No Rule designated as &quot;Meta&quot; may be repealed or modified in any
      way except with unanimous consent of all Players.  Initially,
      Rules 101, 102, and 103 are Meta Rules.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">
Rule 104--Platonic (4)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      Initially, Rules in the 100s are of Order Platonic and Rules in the
      200s are of Order Pragmatic.  Rules subsequently enacted or Transmuted
      (i.e. changed from Order Platonic to Order Pragmatic or vice versa)
      may be Platonic or Pragmatic regardless of their numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their numbers.

Rule 105--Platonic (4)

      All Rules lie within a certain Class.  Except for Meta, every Class
      may be uniquely specified with a number.  The Rules which are most
      fundamentally important to the Game lie in Class Meta, but all other
      Rules are grouped into numbered Classes beginning at 1 for the least
      important.  Initially, Rules are grouped as follows:
