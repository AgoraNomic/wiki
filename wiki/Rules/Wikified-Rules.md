==Rule 101/17 The Game of Agora

(Power=3)

      Agora is a game of Nomic, wherein Persons, acting in accordance
      with the Rules, communicate their game Actions and/or results of
      these actions via Fora in order to play the game.  The game may
      be won, but the game never ends.

      Please treat Agora Right Good Forever.

[CFJ 24: Players must obey the Rules even in out-of-game actions.]

[CFJ 825 (called 7 November 1995): Players must obey the Rules even if
no Rule says so.]

[CFJ 1848 (called 21 December 2007): The game must operate according
to the rules that prevail at the time, and not attempt to incorporate
any retroactive changes made in the future.]

[CFJ 1709 (called 26 July 2007): The rules are binding on all those
who play the game in the broader sense, regardless of whether they
have the rule-defined status of "player".]

[CFJs 1911-1914 (called 18 March 2008): Physical realities supersede
the Rules by default.]

Rule 869/39 (Power=3)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Any organism that is generally capable of freely originating and
      communicating independent thoughts and ideas is a person.  Rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding, no other entities are persons.

      Citizenship is a person switch with values Unregistered
      (default) and Registered, tracked by the Registrar.  Changes to
      citizenship are secured.  A registered person is a Player.

      A person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or prevented by the
      rules) register by publishing a message that indicates
      reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e intends
      to become a player at that time.  A person, by registering,
      agrees to abide by the Rules.  The Rules CANNOT otherwise bind a
      person to abide by any agreement without that person's willful
      consent.

      A player CAN deregister (cease being a player) by announcement.
      If e does so, e CANNOT register by announcement for 30 days.

      If a player has not sent a message to a public forum in the last
      month, then any player CAN deregister em without objection. 

      The Rules CANNOT compel non-players to act, nor compel players
      to unduly harass non-players.  A non-person CANNOT be a player,
      rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

[CFJ 1275 (called 19 February 2001): An entity is a Player if the
Rules cannot distinguish that entity from a Player.]

[CFJ 1263 (called 5 February 2001): Any message expressing a clear
desire or intent to register as a Player counts as a request for
registration, whether or not it is explicitly phrased in the manner
stipulated by the rules.]

Rule 2141/9 (Power=3)
Role and Attributes of Rules

      A rule is a type of instrument with the capacity to govern the
      game generally, and is always taking effect.  A rule's content
      takes the form of a text, and is unlimited in scope.

      Every rule has power between 0.1 and 4.0 inclusive.  It is
      not possible for a rule to have a power outside this range.

      Rules have ID numbers, to be assigned by the Rulekeepor.

      Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification.  If a
      rule ever does not have a title, the Rulekeepor SHALL assign a
      title to it by announcement in a timely fashion.

      For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
      the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
      substantive aspects of the rule.  However, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Rulekeepor CAN set rule aspects as
      described elsewhere in this rule.

[CFJ 1498 (called 12 April 2004): A rule's title is not strictly a
name for the rule, and so rule titles are not subject to the
uniqueness requirement on names of rule-defined entities.]

[CFJ 2013 (called 17 June 2009): Rule 2141 does not imply that the
power of rules is physically unlimited: they can only affect the world
outside the game by prescribing or proscribing player behavior.]

[CFJ 2213 (called 7 October 2008): The powers granted to rules by the
first paragraph of Rule 2141 are general, and only apply as otherwise
stated by the Rules.]

Rule 478/33 (Power=3)
Fora

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that no Player
      shall be prohibited from participating in the Fora, nor shall
      any person create physical or technological obstacles that
      unduly favor some players' fora access over others.

      Publicity is a forum switch with values Public, Discussion, and
      Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.  Changes to
      publicity are secured.

      The Registrar may change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:

      (a) e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and

      (b) if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
          the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all
          existing public fora.

      Each player should ensure e can receive messages via each public
      forum.

      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent
      to all players and containing a clear designation of intent to
      be public.  A rule can also designate that a part of one public
      message is considered a public message in its own right. A
      person "publishes" or "announces" something by sending a public
      message.

      Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
      announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously
      and clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs
      it.  Any action performed by sending a message is performed at
      the time date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages
      (including sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear
      in the message, unless otherwise specified.

[CFJs 1451-1452 (called 6 March 2003): A message that is split into
multiple email messages can qualify as a single message for game
purposes, if it is obvious how to combine the parts to reconstruct the
single message.]

[CFJ 752 (called 13 March 1995): Something sent to a Player who is
obligated to send it to all Players is sufficient for sending
something to the PF.]

[CFJ 813 (called 22 October 1995): A Player need not prove that e can
receive the PF.]

[CFJ 831 (called 10 November 1995): The Date: header of a message is
not necessarily the time at which the message takes effect.]

[CFJ 2205 (called 2 October 2008): A message takes effect at exactly
one of the times date-stamped on it; selecting which one is a matter
of game custom.]

[CFJ 2212 (called 7 October 2008): An IRC channel is a forum.]

[CFJ 2211 (called 7 October 2008): It is generally possible for an IRC
channel to be a public forum.

[CFJ 2214 (called 7 October 2008): Some IRC messages, such as NICK,
are sent to all members of an IRC channel but are not sent via that
channel.]

[CFJ 866 (called 8 April 1996): A message is "received" when the
message enters the recipient's normal technical domain of control,
whether this be eir private machine or eir private account on a shared
machine (but not the shared machine itself, if the recipient does not
control it).]

[CFJ 1112: In order to submit a Proposal, in the sense of R1865 and
elsewhere, it is not sufficient that a collection of text 'with the
clear indication that that text is intended to become a Proposal'
(R1483) merely be sent to the Public Forum by a Proposing Entity; the
collection of text must also be received in the Public Forum.]

[CFJ 1314 (called 15 August 2001): If a message sent to a public forum
is rejected by the list moderator, it still qualifies as having been
sent via a public forum.]

[CFJ 1905 (called 7 February 2008): Regardless of CFJ 1314, a message
has not been sent via a forum until most persons who have arranged to
receive messages via the forum receive it.]

[CFJ 1888 (called 31 January 2008): Sending a message to a Discussion
Forum, or other mailing list except for a Public Forum, does not
qualify as sending it to all players.]

[CFJ 1631 (called 29 April 2007): Public announcements must be made in
the message body; the subject line is insignificant.]

[CFJ 1784 (called 5 November 2007): An undescriptive or misleading
subject line does not deprive the message body of effect.]

[CFJ 1880 (called 22 January 2008): A phrase that would, in the
message body, cancel the effect of the rest of the message, does not
have such an effect if it appears in the subject line.]

[CFJ 1761 (called 30 September 2007): Publishing part of a message is
a different action from publishing the whole message.]

[CFJ 1646 (called 30 April 2007): The act of "publishing" or
"announcing" is accomplished when the message has left the sender's
technical domain of control, indicated by one of the "Received:"
headers.]

[CFJ 1695 (called 23 June 2007): A partnership, which by its nature
can't directly send email, can participate in the fora by means of its
members sending messages on its behalf, if its governing agreement
says so.]

[CFJ 1768 (called 22 October 2007): The right of participation in the
fora is the right to participate in them for their intended purposes,
and is not necessarily infringed by regulations regarding the manner
and type of participation.]

[CFJ 1738 (called 29 August 2007): An obligation on a player to not
publish statements that e believes are true would conflict with the
right of participation in the fora.]

[CFJ 1719 (called 12 August 2007): A player can, if e intends, have
public messages sent on eir behalf, including via a web form that
allows all-comers to send messages on eir behalf without specific
approval.]

[CFJs 1833-1834 (called 18 December 2007): A player can, by
contractual arrangement, grant another player the capacity to act by
announcement on eir behalf.]

[CFJ 1893 (called 3 February 2008): A non-consensual non-contractual
arrangement cannot grant a player the capacity to act by announcement
on behalf of another.]

[CFJ 2397 (caled 3 March 2009): A player can grant or revoke
permission at will for another player to act by announcement on eir
behalf.]

[CFJ 2322 (called 24 December 2008): The ability to act on behalf can
be created by any willful agreement.]

[CFJ 1336 (called 13 December 2001): A public statement that one
wishes to perform an action that one can perform by announcement can
constitute an announcement that performs that action.]

[CFJ 1621 (called 8 February 2007): Where an action can be performed
by announcement, announcing that one deems something to be the case
that would result from that action does not constitute performing the
action.]

[CFJ 1584 (called 24 February 2006), CFJ 1728 (called 20 August 2007):
Saying "I do X 1000 times", where X is something that can be done by
announcement, is an acceptable shorthand for 1000 instances of "I do
X", but this shorthand cannot be used with an infinite repeat count,
because it is impossible to write out an infinite number of instances
of "I do X".]

[CFJ 1774 (called 1 November 2007): Saying "I do X 10000 times", where
X is something that can be done by announcement, does not necessarily
achieve 10000 instances of X, if writing out 10000 instances of "I do
X" would be a substantial effort such that using the shorthand is
abusive.  The presumption is in favour of the shorthand being
successful.]

[CFJ 1775 (called 1 November 2007): If an announcement of the form "I
do X N times" is not be acceptable shorthand for N instances of "I do
X", then the announcement is completely nullified, and does not have
the effect of M instances of "I do X" for any non-zero repeat count
M.]

[CFJ 1730 (called 22 August 2007): An appropriate announcement will
accomplish an action even if its author believed the action was
impossible.]

[CFJ 1841 (called 20 December 2007): A message-based action cannot be
retroactive.]

[CFJ 1971 (called 22 May 2008): An announcement with a general
disclaimer as to its contents cannot fulfill a requirement to report
information, but it may successfully cause game actions to be taken if
the actions do not depend on the truth value of the disclaimed
contents.]

[CFJ 2133 (called 9 August 2008): A disclaimed statement cannot cause
an action to be taken by announcement.]

[CFJ 2112 (called 23 July 2008): An action is only taken by
announcement if the Rules define it as such; e.g., posting an
objection to a dependent action is not an action taken by
announcement.]

[CFJ 2151 (called 5 September 2008): Some unregulated actions, such as
celebrating and revealing things, can be taken by announcement.]

[CFJ 2086 (called 15 July 2008): Message-based actions are always
taken in some order, never precisely simultaneously, possibly unless
otherwise stated.]

[CFJ 2179 (called 23 September 2008): An message-based action can be
taken even if its sender cannot be identified.]

[CFJ 2221 (called 13 October 2008): When an action is specified as
"can do X in order to do Y", and a player does X without specifying
intent to do Y, e does not do Y.]

Rule 2449/2 (Power=3)
Winning the Game

      When the Rules state that a person or persons win the game,
      those persons win the game; specifically they win the Round
      that ends with the indicated win.  Agora itself does not end and
      the ruleset remains unchanged. The Herald is then authorized to
      award those persons the Patent Title of Champion.

Agora Is A Nomic

      Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable
      combination of actions by players to cause arbitrary rule
      changes to be made and/or arbitrary proposals to be adopted
      within a four-week period.

      If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause
      Agora to become ossified, or would cause Agora to cease to
      exist, it cannot take effect, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.  If any other single change to the gamestate
      would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause Agora to
      cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

Rule 2125/8 (Power=3)
Regulation Regulations

      An action is regulated if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable,
      or permit its performance; (2) describe the circumstances under
      which the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action would,
      as part of its effect, modify information for which some player
      is required to be a recordkeepor.

      Regulated Actions CAN only be performed as described by the
      Rules.  The Rules SHALL NOT be interpreted so as to proscribe
      unregulated actions.

Rule 1688/8 (Power=3)
Power

      The Power of an entity is a non-negative rational number.  An
      Instrument is an entity with positive Power.

      The Power of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
      stipulated by the Rules.  All entities have Power zero except
      where specifically allowed by the rules.

      Power less than one is called Ephemeral power, and an instrument
      with a power less than one is an Ephemeral instrument.

      A Rule that makes a change, action, or value secured (hereafter
      the securing Rule) thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that
      change or action, or to set or modify that value, except as
      allowed by an Instrument with Power greater than or equal to the
      change's Power Threshold.  This Threshold defaults to the
      securing Rule's Power, but CAN be lowered as allowed by that
      Rule (including by the Rule itself).

Rule 2140/1 (Power=3)
Power Controls Mutability

      No entity with power below the power of this rule can

      (a) cause an entity to have power greater than its own.

      (b) adjust the power of an instrument with power greater than
          its own.

      (c) set or modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument
          with power greater than its own.  A "substantive" aspect of
          an instrument is any aspect that affects the instrument's
          operation.

[CFJ 2981 (called 21 March 2011): An attribute of an instrument is not

Rule 1030/11 (Power=3.2)
Precedence between Rules

      In a conflict between Rules, the conflict shall be resolved by
      performing the following comparisons in the sequence written in
      this rule, until the conflict is resolved.

      - In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule
        with the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the
        lower Power; otherwise,

      - If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
        precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
        determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
        the precedence-determining Rule shall be used to resolve the
        conflicts; otherwise,

      - If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
        itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
        takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then
        such provisions shall be used to resolve the conflict, unless
        they lead to contradictions between each other; otherwise,

      - If any of the rules in conflict have ID numbers, then the Rule
        with the lowest ID number takes precedence; otherwise,

      - The Rule enacted earliest takes precedence.

      Clauses in any other rule that broadly claim precedence (e.g.
      over "all rules" of a certain class) shall be, prima facie,
      considered to be limited claims of precedence or deference that
      are applicable only when such claims are evaluated as described
      within the above sequence.

      No change to the Ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule to
      directly claim precedence over this Rule as a means of
      determining precedence.  This applies to changes by the
      enactment or amendment of a Rule, or of any other form.  This
      Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would permit such a
      change to the Ruleset.

[CFJ 1104 (called 20 August 1998): The presence in a Rule of deference
clause, claiming that the Rule defers to another Rule, does not
prevent a conflict with the other Rule arising, but shows only how the
Rule says that conflict is to be resolved when it does arise.]

[CFJs 1114-1115 (called 27 January 1999): This Rule is to be applied
to resolve Rule conflicts on a case-by-case basis; just because a Rule
is inapplicable in one situation due to conflict with a Rule of higher
precedence does not mean that the Rule is nullified in all cases.]

Mechanisms
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 105/12 (Power=3)
Rule Changes

      Where permitted by other rules, an instrument generally can,
      as part of its effect,

      (a) enact a rule.  The new rule has power equal to the minimum
          of the power specified by the enacting instrument,
          defaulting to one if the enacting instrument does not
          specify or if it specifies a power less than 0.1, and the
          maximum power permitted by other rules.  The enacting
          instrument may specify a title for the new rule, which if
          present shall prevail.  The ID number of the new rule cannot
          be specified by the enacting instrument; any attempt to so
          specify is null and void.

      (b) repeal a rule.  When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a
          rule, and the Rulekeepor need no longer maintain a record
          of it.

      (c) reenact a rule.  A repealed rule identified by its most
          recent rule number may be reenacted with the same ID number
          and the next change identifier.  If no text is specified,
          the rule is reenacted with the same text it had when it was
          most recently repealed.  If the reenacting proposal provides
          new text for the rule, the rule must have materially the
          same purpose as did the repealed version; otherwise, the
          attempt to reenact the rule is null and void.

      (d) amend the text of a rule.

      (e) retitle a rule.

      (f) change the power of a rule.

      A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
      Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.

      Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that
      change to be void and without effect.  An inconsequential
      variation in the quotation of an existing rule does not
      constitute ambiguity for the purposes of this rule, but any
      other variation does.

      A rule change is wholly prevented from taking effect unless its
      full text was published, along with an unambiguous and clear
      specification of the method to be used for changing the rule, at
      least 4 days and no more than 60 days before it would otherwise
      take effect.

      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can
      become a rule or cease to be a rule.

[CFJ 1499 (called 20 April 2004), CFJ 1623 (called 1 April 2007): If a
low-power rule states that an officer can repeal the rule under
certain circumstances, then the rule cannot actually be repealed by
this process, because the officer, not being an instrument, is
categorically incapable of performing rule changes; this is different
from the situation where a rule can be triggered to repeal itself.]

[CFJ 708 (called October 1994): An Amendment of a non-existing Rule is
not a legal Rule Change.]

[CFJ 1625 (called 1 April 2007): Where a proposal specifies a rule to
amend by both number and title, and the number and title given
identify different rules, this constitutes ambiguity that nullifies
the attempted rule change.]

[CFJ 1644 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Change the power of rule NNNN to P and amend it by XXX.",
where XXX specifies a text change, this constitutes two attempted rule
changes.]

[CFJ 1638 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX.  Amend rule NNNN by YYY.", this
constitutes two separate attempts at rule changes, even though both
attempt to amend the same rule.]

[CFJ 1642 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX.  Further amend rule NNNN by YYY.",
where both XXX and YYY specify text changes, this constitutes two
separate attempts at rule changes.]

[CFJ 1640 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
change, even though it is specified in two parts.]

[CFJ 1641 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and by YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
change, even though it is specified in two parts.]

[CFJ 1643 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal specifies a single
rule amendment in two parts, and one of the parts is not possible but
the other is possible, the possible part is applied alone.]

[CFJ 2201 (called 30 September 2008): The permission required by Rule
105 need not be explicit.]

Rule 106/36 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      When a decision about whether to adopt a proposal is resolved,
      if the outcome is ADOPTED, then the proposal in question is
      adopted, and unless other rules prevent it from taking effect,
      its power is set to the minimum of four and its adoption index,
      and then it takes effect.  Except as prohibited by other rules,
      a proposal that takes effect CAN and does, as part of its
      effect, apply the changes that it specifies.  If the proposal
      cannot make some such changes, this does not preclude the other
      changes from taking place.

      If there is no Agoran Decision to adopt a particular proposal
      that has an outcome of ADOPTED, that proposal CANNOT take
      effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

      Preventing a proposal from taking effect is a secured change;
      this does not apply to generally preventing changes to specified
      areas of the gamestate, nor to a proposal preventing itself from
      taking effect (its no-effect clause is generally interpreted as
      applying only to the rest of the proposal).

[CFJ 1639 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal attempts two
separate amendments of the text of the same rule, if one of the
attempted amendments is not possible and the other is then the
possible amendment does in fact occur, unless the proposal explicitly
requires a different resolution.]

[CFJ 1841 (called 20 December 2007): It is possible for a proposal to
have retroactive effect.]

[CFJ 2162 (called 14 September 2008): The retroactive effect of a
proposal cannot actually alter the past.]

[CFJ 2163 (called 14 September 2008): There is no possible proposal
text that would cause a proposal to take effect without being
adopted.]

[CFJ 2259 (called 6 November 2008): The possibility of the
instantaneous effects of a proposal are governed by the rules.]

Rule 2162/6 (Power=2)
Switches

      A type of switch is a property that the rules define as a
      switch, and specify the following:

      a) The type(s) of entity possessing an instance of that switch.
         No other entity possesses an instance of that switch.

      b) One or more possible values for instances of that switch,
         exactly one of which is designated as the default.  No other
         values are possible for instances of that switch.

      c) Optionally, exactly one office whose holder tracks instances
         of that switch.  That officer's (weekly, if not specified
         otherwise) report includes the value of each instance of that
         switch whose value is not its default value; a public
         document purporting to be this portion of that officer's
         report is self-ratifying, and implies that other instances
         are at their default value.

      At any given time, each instance of a switch has exactly one
      possible value for that type of switch.  If an instance of a
      switch comes to have a value, it ceases to have any other value.
      If an instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a
      possible value, it comes to have its default value.

      "To flip an instance of a switch" is to make it come to have a
      given value.  "To become X" (where X is a possible value of
      exactly one of the subject's switches) is to flip that switch to
      X.

      If an action or set of actions would cause the value of an
      instance of a switch to become indeterminate, the instance
      instead takes on its last determinate and possible value, if
      any, otherwise it takes on its default value.

      A natural switch is a switch with a default value of 0, unless
      the rules explicitly specify a different default value.  If the
      rules define an upper limit for the switch, then the possible
      values are non-negative integers not greater than that limit,
      otherwise the values are the non-negative integers.

      A singleton switch is a switch for which Agora Nomic is the only
      entity possessing an instance of that switch.

Rule 1728/33 (Power=3)
Dependent Actions

      A rule which purports to allow a person (the performer) to
      perform an action by a set of one or more of the following
      methods (N is 1 unless otherwise specified):

       1) Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer no
          greater than 8.  ("Without Objection" is shorthand for this
          method with N = 1.)
       2) With N Supporters, where N is a positive integer.  ("With
          Support" is shorthand for this method with N = 1.)
       3) With N Agoran Consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1
          with a minimum of 1.
       4) With Notice.

      thereby allows em to perform the action by announcement if all
      of the following are true:

       a) A person (the initiator) announced intent to perform the
          action, unambiguously and clearly specifying the action and
          method(s) (including the value of N for each method), at
          most fourteen days earlier, and (if the action depends on
          objections or notice) at least 4 days earlier.

       b) At least one of the following is true:

            1) The performer is the initiator.

            2) The initiator was authorized to perform the action due
               to holding a rule-defined position now held by the
               performer.

            3) The initiator is authorized to perform the action, the
               action depends on support, the performer has supported
               the intent, and the rule authorizing the performance
               does not explicitly prohibit supporters from performing
               it.

       c) Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by
          other rules.

       d) If a set of conditions for the performance of the action was
          given in the announcement of intent to perform the action,
          all those conditions are met.

      The actor SHOULD publish a list of supporters if the action
      depends on support, and a list of objectors if it depends on
      objections.

[CFJ 1722 (called 15 August 2007): The method of dependent action need
not be described exactly: an approximate but inexact description
suffices, as does the rule-defined term.]

[CFJ 1802 (called 19 November 2007): The phrase "by Agoran Support" is
not an unambiguous description of a method of dependent action.]

Rule 2124/18 (Power=2)
Agoran Satisfaction

      A Supporter of a dependent action is an eligible entity who has
      publicly posted (and not withdrawn) support (syn. "consent") for
      an announcement of intent to perform the action.  An Objector to
      a dependent action is an eligible entity who has publicly posted
      (and not withdrawn) an objection to the announcement of intent
      to perform the action.

      The entities eligible to support or object to a dependent action
      are, by default, all players, subject to modification by the
      document authorizing the dependent action.  However, the
      previous sentence notwithstanding, the Executor of the
      announcement of intent is not eligible to support it.

      Agora is Satisfied with an intent to perform a specific action
      if and only if:

      (1) if the action is to be performed Without N Objections, then
          it has fewer than N objectors;

      (2) if the action is to be performed With N supporters, then it
          has N or more supporters; and

      (3) if the action is to be performed with N Agoran Consent, then
          the ratio of supporters to objectors is greater than N, or
          the action has at least one supporter and no objectors.

      The above notwithstanding, if the action depends on objections,
      and an objection to it has been withdrawn within the past 24
      hours, then Agora is not Satisfied with the intent.

      The above notwithstanding, Agora is not satisfied with the
      intent if the Speaker has objected to it in the last 48 hours.

      A person CANNOT support or object to an announcement of intent
      before the intent is announced, or after e has withdrawn the
      same type of response.

Rule 1006/38 (Power=2)
Offices

      Officeholder is an office switch tracked by the ADoP, with
      possible values of any person or "vacant".  An officer is the
      holder of an office, who may be referred to by the name of that
      office.  If the holder of an office is ever not a player, it
      becomes vacant.

      An imposed office is an office described as such by the rule
      defining it.  All others are elected.  A person CANNOT be made
      the holder of an elected office without eir explicit or
      reasonably implied consent.

      The holder of an elected office CAN resign it by announcement,
      causing it to become vacant. Any player CAN cause an office to
      become vacant without 2 objections.

[CFJ 1660 (called 13 May 2007): This rule does not define the meaning
of the term "office", in the sense meant by Rule 754, but rather
references the usual English definition of "office" and governs
offices as thus defined.]

[CFJ 1702 (called 12 July 2007): A requirement to submit something to
an officer is satisfied by publishing it, even if that office is
vacant at the time.]

Rule 103/22 (Power=2)
The Speaker

      The Speaker is an imposed office and the figurehead leader of
      Agora.

      The player or players who have most recently won the game are
      called Laureled. If at any time the office of Speaker is vacant,
      or when one or more players win Agora, then the Prime Minister
      CAN and SHALL, once and in a timely fashion, appoint a Laureled
      player to the office of Speaker.

      If the office of Speaker has been held continuously by the same
      person for 90+ days, then any player CAN appoint another player
      to the office with Support.

      The offices of the Speaker and the Prime Minister are
      incompatible. If at any point in time one player holds both of
      these offices, e ceases to hold the position of Prime Minister.

      For an election of the Prime Minister, the Speaker has voting
      strength one greater than e would have if e did not hold the
      office.

Rule 2423/0 (Power=2)
First Among Equals

      The Prime Minister is an office. The Prime Minister is elected
      by the players of Agora primarily on account of not being the
      other guy. The Prime Minister SHOULD ensure that Agoran affairs
      proceed smoothly.

      The holder of the office of Prime Minister has voting strength
      one greater than e would have if e did not hold the office. This
      does not apply in respect of an election of the Prime Minister.

Rule 2451/0 (Power=1)
Executive Orders

      Once per week and except as otherwise forbidden by this
      rule, the current Prime Minister CAN issue a Cabinet Order
      and perform the action(s) authorized by that Order.

      Each Cabinet Order is associated with an office. The current
      Prime Minister CANNOT issue more than one Cabinet Order
      associated with the same office more than once in the same
      month, nor can e issue a Cabinet Order associated with a
      vacant office.

      The available Cabinet Orders are:

      - Certiorari (CotC): The Prime Minister assigns emself as
        judge of a specified open case.

      - Dive (Referee): The Prime Minister issues a specified Card
        to a specified player. In doing so, the Prime Minister
        SHOULD cite a specific grievance against that player, not
        necessarily a violation of a rule.

      - Manifesto (Promotor): The Prime Minister distributes a
        specified proposal in the Proposal Pool.

Rule 2154/49 (Power=2)
Election Procedure

      A player CAN initiate an election for a specified elected office
      for which no election is already in progress

      a) by announcement, if e is the ADoP, if the office has been
         deputised for within the past two weeks, or if no election
         has been initiated for the office either since the last time
         a player won the game or within the past 90 days;

      b) with 4 Supporters, otherwise.

      After the election is initiated, any player CAN once initiate an
      Agoran decision to determine the new officeholder, and the ADoP
      SHALL do so in a timely fashion if no one else does first.  For
      this decision, the valid options are the players, the vote
      collector is the ADoP, and the voting method is instant runoff.
      Upon the resolution of this decision, its outcome, if a player,
      is installed into office, and the election ends.

Proposals
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2350/9 (Power=3)
Proposals

      A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text and
      other attributes.  A player CAN create a proposal by
      announcement, specifying its text and optionally specifying any
      of the following attributes:

      * An associated title.
      * A list of co-authors (which must be persons other than the
        author).
      * An adoption index.

      Creating a proposal adds it to the Proposal Pool.  Once a
      proposal is created, nether its text nor any of the
      aforementioned attributes can be changed.  The author (syn.
      proposer) of a proposal is the person who submitted it.

      If a decision of whether to adopt a proposal was resolved as
      FAILED QUORUM in the last seven days, the Promotor CAN once add
      the proposal back to the Proposal Pool by announcement.

      The author of a proposal in the Proposal Pool CAN remove (syn.
      retract, withdraw) it from the Pool by announcement.

      The Promotor CAN remove a proposal from the Proposal Pool by
      announcement if it is not pending and has been added to the Pool
      more than 14 days ago.

[CFJ 1647 (called 30 April 2007): Preceding a proposal-like text with
the heading "Proposal:" and a title can be sufficient to clearly
indicate that it is intended to become a proposal, but is not if it
can be interpreted as quoting an existing proposal.]

[CFJ 1717 (called 8 August 2007): Preceding a proposal-like text with
the question "What is the title of this proposal?" can be sufficient
to clearly indicate that it is intended to become a proposal.]

Rule 2445/3 (Power=1)
How to Pend a Proposal

      Imminence is a switch, tracked by the Promotor, possessed by
      proposals in the Proposal Pool, whose value is either "pending"
      or "not pending" (default).

      Spending power is an office switch, whose values range over the
      positive integers between 1 and 10 inclusive, with a default of
      1. Spending power is tracked by the ADoP. The ADoP CAN flip
      the spending power of an office by announcement, provided that
      the Promotor always has spending power no less than 1 less than
      the greatest spending power among offices, and further provided
      that the current ADoP has not already flipped that office's
      spending power in the current month.

      A player can flip a proposal's imminence to "pending" by
      announcement, unless e has already done so a number of times
      that week that equals or exceeds the total spending power of the
      offices e holds.

Rule 2443/0 (Power=3)
Expediting Proposals

      A player CAN expedite a proposal whose adoption index is at most
      1.5, in a message containing the character string "[Expedition]"
      in the subject line,

        (a) by specially deputising for the Promotor to distribute the
            proposal, if it has not been distributed; or
        (b) by announcement, otherwise.

      If, in an Agoran Decision to adopt a proposal, the strength of
      AGAINST is zero, and the proposal was expedited at least 7 days
      earlier, then any player CAN specially deputise for the Assessor
      to resolve the decision.

History:
Created by Proposal 7713 (Warrigal), 9 November 2014

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1607/42 (Power=3)
Distribution

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      receiving and distributing proposals.

      Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision.
      For this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, the
      adoption index is initially the adoption index of the proposal,
      or 1.0 if the proposal does not have one, and the text of the
      proposal is an essential parameter.  Initiating such a decision
      is known as distribution, and removes the proposal from the
      Proposal Pool.

      The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
      Pool at any time. The Promotor SHALL NOT distribute proposals
      which are not pending.

      In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL, as part of eir
      weekly duties, distribute all pending proposals.

      Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
      Promotor.

      If there is a Proposal in the Pool that it would otherwise be
      IMPOSSIBLE for any player to distribute, then any player CAN
      distribute that Proposal Without 3 Objections.

      The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
      Proposal Pool, along with their text and attributes.  This
      portion of a public document purporting to be a Promotor's
      report is self-ratifying.

[CFJ 1546 (called 14 April 2005), CFJ 1669 (called 16 May 2007): If a
proposal is purportedly distributed with a text that differs from the
submitted text, this constitutes a legal distribution of the submitted
proposal if and only if the difference does not affect the meaning of
the proposal.]

[CFJ 1655 (called 9 May 2007): Distributing a purported proposal whose
text consists of the texts of two submitted proposals and separating
matter from the message that submitted them both, if both submitted
proposals have non-null effects, does not constitute a legal
distribution of either of the submitted proposals.]

[CFJ 1656 (called 9 May 2007): If the Promotor purports to distribute
a proposal, but the distributed text does not match any proposal in
the proposal pool, this constitutes the effective (albeit prohibited)
distribution of a new proposal.]

[CFJ 1780 (called 4 November 2007): If the Promotor creates a new
proposal by distribution, by accidentally mangling the text of a
proposal in the pool, and the new proposal is very similar in meaning
to the one on which it is based (with only inconsequential
differences), then the author of the new proposal is the author of the
proposal on which it is based.]

[CFJ 1780 (called 4 November 2007): If the Promotor accidentally
creates a new proposal by distribution, and the new proposal is
seriously different from any proposal in the pool, then the new
proposal has no author.]

[CFJ 2733 (called 14 November 2009): This rule defines a separate
method of distribution from the one defined in Rule 107.]

Rule 2431/1 (Power=1)
Proposal Competitions

      Any player CAN, with Agoran Consent, initiate a Proposal
      Competition with a specified Objective. Only one Competition may
      be in progress at a time. The Objective should be a
      specification of effects of a proposal, and SHOULD NOT depend on
      factors that could not be determined from the text of a
      proposal.

      During the Agoran Week following the initiation of a Proposal
      Competition, any player CAN specify that a Proposal e submits is
      a Competition Proposal for that Competition.  Players are
      ENCOURAGED to describe how their Competition Proposals fulfill
      the Objective.

      The Promotor SHALL distribute all Competition Proposals for a
      given Competition in the same message. The Assessor SHALL
      resolve all the Agoran Decisions to adopt the Competition
      Proposals for a given Competition in the same message.

      Once all Agoran decisions to adopt Competition Proposals for a
      given Competition have been resolved, the Competition ends.

Rule 107/18 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision.  This notice is invalid if it lacks
      any of the following information, and the lack is correctly
      identified within one week after the notice is published:

      (a) The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
          proposal 4781").

      (b) A clear indication of the set of valid votes.

      (c) The identity of the vote collector.

      (d) Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
          parameters.

      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
      period for the decision.  The voting period lasts for 7 days.
      The minimum voting period for a decision with at least two
      options is five days.  The vote collector for a decision with
      less than two options CAN and SHALL end the voting period by
      announcement, if it has not ended already, and provided that e
      resolves the decision in the same message.

      The voting period for a decision cannot be set or changed to a
      duration longer than fourteen days.

[CFJ 1650 (called 6 May 2007): The intent to initiate the decision and
the information required in the notice need not be explicit.]

[CFJ 1743 (called 18 September 2007): If the notice does not mention
voter eligibility but the type of Agoran decision is clear and the
rule defining the relevant type of Agoran decision fully determines
the class of eligible voters, then the notice thereby implicitly
describes the class of eligible voters.]

[CFJ 1722 (called 15 August 2007): Information that is explicitly
presented in the notice takes precedence over any information that
would be implicit, even where the explicit information is inaccurate
and the implicit information would have been accurate.]

[CFJ 1651 (called 6 May 2007): If a R107 notice initiating an Agoran
decision does not contain an explicit list of the eligible voters, and
there is later a dispute (evidenced by submission of a CFJ) over which
voters were eligible at that time, then the notice's description of
the class of eligible voters was necessarily insufficient to enable
public agreement on which persons are eligible.]

[CFJ 1652 (called 6 May 2007): The set of eligible voters on an Agoran
decision can change during its voting period.]

Rule 208/11 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran Decisions

      The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
      it by announcement, indicating the outcome.  If it was required
      to be initiated, then e SHALL resolve it in a timely fashion
      after the end of the voting period.  To be valid, this
      announcement must satisfy the following conditions:

      (a) It is published after the voting period has ended.

      (b) It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.

      (c) It specifies the outcome, as described elsewhere, and, if
          there was more than one valid option, provides a tally of
          the voters' valid ballots.

      Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector, defaulting
      to the initiator of the decision.  If the vote collector is
      defined by reference to a position (or, in the default case, if
      the initiator was so defined), then the vote collector is the
      current holder of that position.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.

      In general, changes to the gamestate due to the outcome of an
      Agoran decision take effect when the decision is resolved.

[CFJ 1711 (called 1 August 2007): If a purported resolution notice
refers via a References: header to a previous notice with an
incomplete vote tally and lists additional votes but does not give
revised totals, this does not qualify as including a vote tally.]

[CFJ 1810 (called 28 November 2007): If a purported resolution notice
refers via an approximate date header to a previous notice with an
incomplete vote tally and lists additional votes but does not give
revised totals, this does qualify as including a vote tally.]

[CFJ 1822 (called 4 December 2007): If a purported resolution notice
includes invalid votes in its tally of votes, this makes the notice
invalid.]

Rule 1950/31 (Power=3)
Decisions with Adoption Indices

      Adoption index is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
      decisions and proposals, whose value is either "none" (default)
      or an integral multiple of 0.1 from 1.0 to 9.9.

      Adoption index is secured with a power threshold of 2.

      An Agoran decision with an adoption index has the following
      essential parameters:

      a) Its adoption index.
      b) Its author (and co-authors, if any).

      For any Agoran decision with an adoption index, the voting
      method is AI-majority.

[CFJ 1885 (called 26 January 2008): "AGAINT" is a variant spelling of
"AGAINST", not a customary synonym for "FOR", despite its former
private usage with the latter meaning.]

Quorum

      Quorum for an Agoran Decision is equal to the number of players
      who voted on the most recently resolved Agoran Decision to adopt
      a proposal, minus 3.

[CFJ 1562 (called 3 May 2005): A cancelled vote on a Proposal does not
count towards quorum.]

[CFJs 1673-1675 (called 20 May 2007): Quorum for an Agoran decision
changes as the set of eligible voters changes.]

Voting
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 683/21 (Power=3)
Voting on Agoran Decisions

      An entity submits a ballot on an Agoran decision by publishing a
      notice satisfying the following conditions:

      (a) The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
          decision.

      (b) The entity casting the ballot (the voter) was, at the
          initiation of the decision, a player.

      (c) The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.

      (d) The ballot clearly identifies a valid vote, as determined by
          the voting method.

      (e) The voter has not publicly retracted the ballot during the
          voting period.  ("Changing" a vote is equivalent to
          retracting it and casting a vote with the new value.)

      (f) It is the most recent of the voter's otherwise-valid
          ballots.

[CFJ 1609 (called 13 January 2007): To "clearly identif[y] the matter
to be decided" does not necessarily require specifying it in detail.]

[CFJs 1852-1853 (called 23 December 2007): Claiming to submit more
votes than ones voting limit on the decision does not constitute the
making of a false statement.]

Rule 2422/0 (Power=3)
Voting Strength

      The voting strength of an entity is an integer between 1 and 5
      inclusive, defined by rules of power 2 or greater. If not
      otherwise specified, the voting strength of an entity is 1.

Rule 2127/9 (Power=3)
Conditional Votes

      If a vote on an Agoran decision is submitted conditionally (e.g.
      "FOR if <X> is true, otherwise AGAINST"), then the selected
      option is evaluated based on the value of the condition(s) at
      the end of the voting period, and, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, is clearly specified if and only if the value
      of the condition(s) is/are determinate at the end of the voting
      period.  If the option cannot be clearly identified, a vote of
      PRESENT is cast.

      Casting a vote endorsing another voter is equivalent to
      conditionally casting a vote whose value is the same as the most
      common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on that
      decision.

      Casting a vote denouncing another voter is equivalent to
      conditionally casting a vote whose value is opposite to the most
      common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on that
      decision.  FOR and AGAINST are opposites.

[CFJ 2449 (called 14 April 2009): For an endorsement or denouncement,
the identity of the voter in question is part of the condition.]

Rule 2168/7 (Power=1)
Extending the voting period

      Whenever the voting period of an Agoran decision would end, and
      the result would be FAILED QUORUM, the length of the voting
      period for that decision is instead increased to 14 days, except
      if it is already that length, provided this has not already
      happened for the decision in question.

      Upon such an occurrence, the vote collector for the decision
      SHALL issue a humiliating public reminder to the slackers who
      have not yet cast any votes on it despite being eligible, and
      CAN end its voting period by announcement (resolving it
      constitutes an implicit announcement that its voting period is
      first ended) if the result would no longer be FAILED QUORUM, or
      if the decision is whether to adopt a proposal and no voter
      (other than possibly the proposal's author) has voted FOR.

Rule 955/20 (Power=3)
Determining the Will of Agora

      Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which determines how
      voters may vote on it and how to calculate the outcome.  The
      following voting methods are defined:

      (1) AI-majority: the valid votes are FOR and AGAINST.  Let F be
          the total voting strength of all voters with valid ballots
          cast FOR a decision, A be the same for AGAINST, and AI be
          the adoption index of the decision.  The outcome is ADOPTED
          if F/A >= AI and F/A > 1 (or F>0 and A=0), otherwise
          REJECTED.

          This is the only voting method which takes voting strength
          into account.

      (2) Instant runoff: the valid votes are ordered lists of
          options, and the outcome is whichever option wins according
          to the standard definition of instant runoff.  In case
          multiple valid options tie for the lowest number of votes at
          any stage, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
          announcement of the decision's resolution, select one such
          option to eliminate; if, for N > 1, all eir possible choices
          in the next N stages would result in the same set of options
          being eliminated, e need not specify the order of
          elimination.

      (3) First-past-the-post (default): the valid votes are the
          options, and the outcome is whichever option received the
          most votes.  In case of a tie, the vote collector CAN and
          must, in the announcement of the decision's resolution,
          select one of the leaders as the outcome.

      The previous notwithstanding:

      - If there is more than one option, and the number of valid
        ballots is less than quorum, the outcome is instead FAILED
        QUORUM.
      - PRESENT is always a valid vote, with no effect on the outcome
        except counting towards quorum.
      - If there are no valid options, the outcome is null.

      The outcome of a decision is determined when it is resolved, and
      cannot change thereafter.

[CFJs 1673-1675 (called 20 May 2007): Quorum for an Agoran decision is
determined at the time the vote collector makes the calculations
described in Rule 955.]

Rule 991/17 (Power=2)
Calls for Judgement

      Any person (the initiator) can initiate a Call for Judgement
      (CFJ, syn. Judicial Case) by announcement, specifying a
      statement to be inquired into.  E may optionally bar one person
      from the case.

      At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
      assigned exactly one judgement.

      The Arbitor is an office, responsible for the administration of
      justice in a manner that is fair for emself, if not for the rest
      of Agora.

      When a CFJ has no judge assigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
      player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so within a
      week.  The players eligible to be assigned as judge are all
      players except the initiator and the person barred (if any).
      The Arbitor SHALL assign judges over time such that all
      interested players have reasonably equal opportunities to judge.
      If a CFJ has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to
      judge that CFJ CAN assign it to emself Without 3 Objections.

[CFJs 1692-1693 (called 20 June 2007): A CFJ can be unambiguously
referenced by using the customarily-assigned sequence numbers, even if
the number was not assigned in the public forum, provided that those
involved accept it as unambiguous at the time.]

[CFJ 1355 (called 28 April 2002): Titles for CFJs are unregulated, so
it is possible for a title to be assigned to a CFJ informally.]

Rule 591/42 (Power=1.7)
Delivering Judgements

      When a CFJ is open and assigned to a judge, that judge CAN
      assign a valid judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so
      in a timely fashion after this becomes possible.  If e does not,
      the Arbitor CAN remove em from being the judge of that case by
      announcement.

      The valid judgements, based on the facts of the case at the time
      the CFJ was initiated, are TRUE, FALSE, and DISMISS.  DISMISS is
      appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
      irrelevant to the game, if insufficient information exists to
      make a judgement with reasonable effort, or the statement is
      otherwise not able to be answered TRUE or FALSE.

[CFJ 1835 (called 18 December 2007): A question cannot generally take
the place of a statement in initiating an inquiry case.]

[CFJ 1903 (called 6 February 2008): The question-statement equivalence
established by this rule applies only for the purposes of the subject
of an inquiry case, not for acting by announcement.]

[CFJ 1671 (called 17 May 2007): The truth or falsity of a statement
can be determined as of the initiation of a CFJ even if public
knowledge at the time of initiation was not sufficient to determine
it.]

[CFJ 1482 (called 10 February 2004): If the truth of a CFJ statement
logically depends on the truth of statements of a previously-called
CFJ which has not yet been judged, the judge is entitled to treat this
as a situation of insufficient information being available.]

[CFJ 1744 (called 18 September 2007): It is not the job of the judge
to hunt down or request the information that would be required to
render a substantive judgement.]

[CFJ 1771 (called 28 October 2007): If an inquiry case revolves around
the interpretation of a specific message, and the initiator does not
provide a reasonable reference to that message , the judge is entitled
to treat this as a situation of insufficient information being
available.]

[CFJ 1732 (called 23 August 2007): If a particular player holds a
particular office, and an inquiry case on a statement that that player
holds that office is judged FALSE, that player still holds that
office.]

[CFJ 2281 (called 19 November 2008): For the purposes of determining

Rule 217/11 (Power=3)
Interpreting the Rules

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence.  Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense,
      past judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the
      game.

      Definitions and prescriptions in the rules are only to be
      applied using direct, forward reasoning; in particular, an
      absurdity that can be concluded from the assumption that a
      statement about rule-defined concepts is false does not
      constitute proof that it is true.  Definitions in lower-powered
      Rules do not overrule common-sense interpretations or common
      definitions of terms in higher-powered rules.

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any rule change that
      would (1) prevent a person from initiating a formal process to
      resolve matters of controversy, in the reasonable expectation
      that the controversy will thereby be resolved; or (2) prevent a
      person from causing formal reconsideration of any judicial
      determination that e should be punished, is wholly void and
      without effect.

[CFJ 1439 (called 20 February 2003): A difference in language
qualifies as a difference in dialect; it is possible to take game
actions by messages in languages other than English.]

[CFJ 1460 (called 4 April 2003): If a message is in a language other
than English, and its intended audience does not understand the
language, this constitutes gross unclarity that makes the message
ineffective.]

[CFJ 712: Referring to a Player by a method other than eir name or
nickname is acceptable, as long as it is unambiguous.]

[CFJ 1861 (called 8 January 2008): A player's legal name (legal in eir
country of residence) is not necessarily an acceptable way to refer to
em.]

[CFJ 1782 (called 4 November 2007): Referring to a player by the name
of an office that e holds suffices to identify em uniquely as a
person, if there is no doubt regarding who holds that office.]

[CFJ 1460 (called 4 April 2003): Extremely complex synonyms, requiring
extensive effort to interpret correctly, can constitute a sufficient
degree of unclarity as to render the message ineffective.]

[CFJ 1840 (called 20 December 2007): A proper noun that has not been
explicitly defined does not adequately refer to any entity, and is not
implicitly defined by the context in which it is used.]

[CFJ 1580 (called 12 January 2006): Base64 encoding of (part of) a
message, other than in the context of MIME with appropriate headers,
can render a message ineffective for unclarity, because the decoding
step requires unreasonable effort within the meaning of CFJ 1460.]

[CFJ 1741 (called 11 September 2007): HTML encoding (including
numerical character entity encoding) does not render a message
ineffective for unclarity if a suitable MIME type is indicated by a
header.]

[CFJ 1741 (called 11 September 2007): An email message does not need
the RFC-required "MIME-Version:" header in order for it to be
interpreted in the MIME way.]

[CFJ 1536 (called 13 March 2005): The phrase "AOL!" is not a
sufficiently clear synonym for "Me too!".]

[CFJ 1770 (called 23 October 2007): A contract can redefine a
rule-defined term in its own way, and the contract's definition will
then apply in situations governed by the contract.]

[CFJ 1885 (called 26 January 2008): A word or phrase can acquire a
meaning by custom, provided that it is a reasonable meaning and does
not unreasonably change the meaning of phrases that already have a
meaning.]

[CFJ 1831 (called 10 December 2007): Mentioning a URI, without
surrounding text stating its significance, does not incorporate
anything identified by that URI into the message that mentions the
URI.]

[CFJ 1831 (called 10 December 2007): Character sequences within a URI
by default have no significance other than their functional role as
part of the URI.]

[CFJ 2258 (called 6 November 2008): Changes in whitespace are also
inconsequential.]

[CFJ 1139: Interpretations [judgements at the time of CFJ 1139] need
not necessarily accord with the reasoning and arguments of Judges or
Justices given in past CFJs.]

Rule 2152/7 (Power=3)
Mother, May I?

      The following terms are defined.  These definitions are used
      when a rule includes a term in all caps, and provide guidance in
      determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term when a rule
      includes a term otherwise.  Earlier definitions take precedence
      over later ones.  If a rule specifies one or more persons in
      connection with a term, then the term applies only to the
      specified person(s).

      1. CANNOT, IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID:  Attempts to
         perform the described action are unsuccessful.

      2. MUST NOT, MAY NOT, SHALL NOT, ILLEGAL, PROHIBITED: Performing
         the described action violates the rule in question.

      3. NEED NOT, OPTIONAL:  Failing to perform the described action
         does not violate the rules.

      4. SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED:  Before performing the
         described action, the full implications of performing it
         should be understood and carefully weighed.

      5. CAN: Attempts to perform the described action are successful.

      6. MAY: Performing the described action does not violate the
         rules.

      7. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY:  Failing to perform the
         described action violates the rule in question.

      8. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED:  Before failing to perform
         the described action, the full implications of failing to
         perform it should (in the ordinary-language sense) be
         understood and carefully weighed.

[CFJ 1132: A Player failing to perform a duty required by the Rules
within a reasonable time may be in violation of the Rules, even if the
Rules do not provide a time limit for the performance of that duty.]

[CFJ 1488 (called 11 February 2004): Engineering a situation in which
other players are unable to follow a particular rule is not in itself
a violation of that rule.]

[CFJ 2395 (called 1 March 2009): Even without this being explicitly
specified in the rules, it is possible for a non-player to violate a
rule by missing a deadline.]

[CFJ 1990 (called 7 June 2008): "Allowed" may refer to either
possibility or permissibility depending on context.]

[CFJs 2120-2121 (called 4 August 2008): A requirement of the form
'within <time limit>, a player SHALL <action> by announcement' means
that the player CAN perform the action, and SHALL do so within the
time limit.]

[CFJ 2230 (called 16 October 2008): In a statement of the form "an
action that X may take", 'may' generally means 'might', i.e. CAN.]

[CFJ 2282 (called 19 November 2008): To state that an entity "MUST"
have certain properties refers to possibility, not legality.]

[CFJ 2414 (called 14 March 2009): A rule of the form "X SHOULD be
interpreted as Y" does not allow players to bypass the interpretation
by failing to perform the described action.]

Rule 911/51 (Power=1.7)
Motions and Moots

      If a CFJ (1) has a judgement that has been in effect for less
      than seven days and not been appealed, and (2) has not had a
      Motion to Reconsider filed for it at any time while it has been
      assigned to its current judge, then any Player CAN file a Motion
      to Reconsider the case with 2 Support, or by announcement if e
      is that case's judge.  When a Motion to Reconsider is so filed,
      the case is rendered open again.

      If a CFJ has a judgement assigned, a player CAN enter that
      judgement into Moot with two support.  When this occurs, the CFJ
      is suspended, and the Arbitor is once authorized to initiate the
      Agoran decision to determine public confidence in the judgement,
      which e SHALL do in a timely fashion.

      For this decision, the vote collector is the Arbitor and the
      valid options are AFFIRM, REMAND, and REMIT.  When the decision
      is resolved, the effect depends on the outcome:

      - AFFIRM, FAILED QUORUM: The judgement is reassigned to the case,
        and cannot be entered into Moot again.

      - REMAND: The case becomes open again.

      - REMIT: The case becomes open again, and the current judge is
        recused.  The Arbitor SHALL NOT assign em to the case again
        unless no other eligible judges have displayed interest in
        judging.

[CFJ 1597 (called 22 December 2006): It is possible to appeal a
judgement even if it is not certain that the judgement exists.]

[CFJ 1800 (called 18 November 2007): An announcement of the form "I
call for the appeal of <judgement>" has the effect of initiating the
Agoran decision on whether to approve appealing the cited judgement.]

Rule 2175/9 (Power=1)
Judicial Retraction and Excess

      A new case is a judicial case that has not had any judge
      assigned to it.  The initiator of a new case CAN retract it by
      announcement, thus causing it to cease to be a judicial case.

      An excess case is a new case whose initiator previously
      initiated five or more cases during the same week as that case.
      A person SHALL NOT initiate an excess case.  The Arbitor CAN
      refuse an excess case by announcement, thus causing it to cease
      to be a judicial case.  When e does so, e fulfills any
      obligations with regards to that case.

Rule 1023/34 (Power=2)
Common Definitions

      The following terms are defined:

      (a) The phrase "in a timely fashion" means "within 7 days".
          This time period is set when the requirement is created
          (i.e. X days before the limit ends).  A requirement to
          perform an action at an exact instant (e.g.  "when X, Y
          SHALL Z"), but not "in the same message", is instead
          interpreted as a requirement to perform that action in a
          timely fashion after that instant.

      (b) Agoran epochs:

          (1) Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.

          (2) Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday.

          (3) Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of
              each Gregorian month.

          (4) Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
              April, July, and October begin.

          (5) Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
              begins.

          (5) A pivot is either the instant at which Agora Nomic began
              (June 30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200) or an instant at
              which at least one person won the game.  When used as a
              period of time, a "Round" (historical syn: "game") is
              the period of time between a pivot and the next pivot.

          These definitions do not apply to relative durations (e.g.
          "within <number> days after <event>").

      (c) If a regulated value, or the value of a conditional, or a
          value otherwise required to determine the outcome of a
          regulated action, CANNOT be reasonably determined (without
          circularity or paradox) from information reasonably
          available, or if it alternates instantaneously and
          indefinitely between values, then the value is considered to
          be Indeterminate, otherwise it is Determinate.

      (d) Two points in time are within a month of each other if:

          (1) they occur in the same Agoran month;

          (2) they occur in two consecutive Agoran months, and the
              later of the two occurs in an earlier day in the month
              than the earlier one;

          (3) they occur in two consecutive Agoran months on the same
              day of the month, and the later of the two occurs at the
              same or earlier time of day.

Rule 1769/13 (Power=3)
Holidays

      The period each year from midnight GMT on the morning of 24
      December to the beginning of the first Agoran week to begin
      after 2 January is a Holiday.

      The week that contains the beginning of Agora's Birthday,
      together with the following week, is a Holiday.

      If a person breaks a Rule by missing a deadline that occurs
      during a Holiday, punishment is generally not appropriate.

[CFJ 1434 (called 24 January 2003): The registration of a player is an
event for the purposes of Rule 1769.]

[CFJ 1434 (called 24 January 2003): The expiration of a rule-defined
period is an event for the purposes of Rule 1769.]

[CFJ 1480 (called 5 January 2004): An automatic event specified to
occur at regular calendar intervals, for example quarterly, happens at
its specified time even if that is during a holiday.]

Eras

      An Era is a period of time that has a defined start, either
      has a defined end or is still ongoing, and has been initiated
      as specified by this rule.

      Upon the initiation of an Era, each existing Ephemeral Rule
      (in the order they were created) is repealed, unless the
      initiation specifies otherwise.

      A player CAN initiate a new Era with Agoran Support.

Rule 2426/4 (Power=1)
Cards

      The Referee is an office; its holder is responsible for keeping
      track of wrongdoing.

      The Referee CAN issue a Card to a specified player by
      announcement.  When issuing each Card, e SHALL cite a unique
      violation of the rules e perceives to have occurred within the
      last 14 days, and CANNOT issue more than three Cards per week,
      or one per week to a single player.  The Arbitor CAN issue Black
      Cards to the Referee solely for alleged violations of the former
      requirement.

      The following Cards exist:

      - Green Card, intended for offenses which the Referee does not
        believe warrant effective punishment.  When a Green Card is
        issued, the target player is ENCOURAGED to travel to the
        United States.

      - Red Card, intended for more severe offenses.  The effects of a
        Red Card are described elsewhere.

      - Black Card, naming an office held by the player, intended for
        severe abuses of power (the perceived rule violation must
        involve use or non-use of that office's powers).  Within seven
        days after a Black Card is issued, any player CAN become the
        holder of the target office with two support;  the issuer of
        that Card CANNOT initiate or support this.

      The Referee SHALL issue at least one Card per week, unless no
      violations occurred that week.

Red Cards

      After a Red Card has been issued to a player, e SHOULD publish a

      prescribed words, explaining eir error, shame, remorse, and
      ardent desire for self-improvement; other effects are described

Rule 1789/9 (Power=2)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
      by the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part
      of it, e may submit a document to the Registrar, clearly labeled
      a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and expressing eir
      reproach for those who e feels have treated em so badly.

      In a timely fashion after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the
      Registrar shall publish this document along with a Writ of
      Fugiendae Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the
      Player to be deregistered. The Registrar shall note the method
      of deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar
      Reports.

      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and
      the notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

[CFJ 1594 (called 16 December 2006): Players can be deregistered due
to this rule even if there is no Registrar.]

[CFJ 2358 (called 26 January 2009): A document which is labeled as a
Cantus Cygneus but does not actually detail grievances, etc. is not a
Cantus Cygneus.]

Rule 1681/20 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      The Short Logical Ruleset (SLR) is a format of the ruleset.  In
      this format, each rule is assigned to a category, and the rules
      are grouped according to their category.

      Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty
      categories removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.

      The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's ID
      number, revision number, power, title, and text.

      The Rulekeepor is strongly DISCOURAGED from including any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      The Full Logical Ruleset (FLR) is a format of the ruleset.  In
      this format, rules are assigned to the same category and
      presented in the same order as in the SLR.  The FLR must contain
      all the information required to be in the SLR, and any
      historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to
      record.

      The Rulekeepor SHOULD also include any other information which e
      feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the FLR.

      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor SHALL
      record a historical annotation to the rule indicating:

      a) The type of change.

      b) The date on which the change took effect.

      c) The mechanism that specified the change.

      d) If the rule was changed due to a proposal, then that
         proposal's ID number, author, and co-author(s) (if any).

Rule 2143/24 (Power=1)
Official Reports and Duties

      For each person:

      a) If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
         weekly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each
         week.  If any information is defined by the rules as part of
         that person's weekly report, then e SHALL maintain all such
         information, and the publication of all such information is
         part of eir weekly duties.

      b) If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
         monthly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each
         month.  If any information is defined by the rules as part of
         that person's monthly report, then e SHALL maintain all such
         information, and the publication of all such information is
         part of eir monthly duties.

      Any information defined by the rules as part of a person's
      report, without specifying which one, is part of eir weekly
      report.  Failure of a person to perform any duty required of em
      within the allotted time is the Class-2 crime of Tardiness.

      An official duty for an office is any duty that the Rules
      specifically assign to that office's holder in particular
      (regardless of eir identity).

      A person SHALL NOT publish information that is inaccurate or
      misleading while performing an official duty, or within a
      document purporting to be part of any person or office's weekly
      or monthly report.

      Reports SHALL be published in plain text.  Tabular data must
      line up properly when viewed in a monospaced font.  Publishing a
      report that deviates from these regulations is the Class 2 Crime
      of Making My Eyes Bleed.

      Officers SHOULD maintain a publicly visible copy of their
      reports on the World Wide Web, and they SHOULD publish the
      address of this copy along with their published reports.

[CFJ 2392 (called 27 February 2009): Publishing an intentionally
incomplete report does not satisfy this rule's requirement to publish
a report.]

Rule 2160/14 (Power=3)
Deputisation

      A rule which purports to allow a person (a deputy) to perform an
      action via normal deputisation or special deputisation for an
      office thereby allows them to perform the action as if e held
      the office, as long as

        (a) it would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
            other than by deputisation, if e held the office, and

        (b) the deputy, when performing the action, announces that e
            is doing so by the appropriate form of deputisation.

      Only this rule may allow normal deputisation. Any rule may allow
      special deputisation.

      A player CAN perform an action as if e held a particular office,
      via normal deputisation, if all of the following are true:

        (a) The rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
            holding that office, to perform the action. This
            requirement is fulfilled by the deputy performing the
            action.

        (b) A time limit by which the rules require the action to be
            performed has expired.

        (c) Either (i) the office is vacant; or (ii) the
            aforementioned time limit expired more than fourteen days
            ago; or (iii) the deputy announced between two and
            fourteen days earlier that e intended to deputise for that
            office for the purposes of the particular action.

      When a player deputises via normal deputisation for an elected
      office, e becomes the holder of that office.

[CFJ 1776 (called 1 November 2007): A requirement to perform an
action, for the purposes of this rule, can be a logical implication
from rules and circumstances, not just directly imposed by the rules.
In particular, it is possible to deputise to rotate the bench.]

[CFJ 2400 (called 6 March 2009): Deputisation is generally treated as
if the deputy gained the office immediately before the action, and
lost it immediately after.]

      document as true and accurate as possible.  Such a modification
      cannot add inconsistencies between the gamestate and the rules,
      and it cannot include rule changes unless the ratified document
      explicitly and unambiguously recites either the changes or the
      resulting properties of the rule(s).  If no such modification is
      possible, or multiple substantially distinct possible
      modifications would be equally appropriate, the ratification
      fails.

      An internally inconsistent document generally cannot be
      ratified; however, if such a document can be divided into a
      summary section and a main section, where the only purpose of
      the summary section is to summarize information in the main
      section, and the main section is internally consistent,
      ratification of the document proceeds as if it contained only
      the main section.

      Text purportedly about previous instances of ratification (e.g.
      a report's date of last ratification) is excluded from
      ratification. The rules may define additional information that
      is considered to be part of the document for the purposes of
      ratification; such definitions are secured at a Power
      Threshold of 3.

      Ratifying a public document is secured with power threshold 3.

fictions, but does not always.]

Rule 2202/6 (Power=3)
Ratification Without Objection

      Any player CAN, without objection, ratify a public document,
      specifying its scope.

      Ratification Without Objection CANNOT cause the repeal,
      amendment, enactment, or mutation of any Rule, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      A player SHALL NOT knowingly use or announce intent to use
      Ratification Without Objection to ratify a (prior to
      ratification) document containing incorrect or Indeterminate
      information when a corrected document could be produced with
      reasonable effort, unless the general nature of the document's
      error and reason for ratifying it is clearly and plainly
      described in the announcement of intent.  Such ratification
      or announcement of intent to ratify is the Class-8 Crime of
      Endorsing Forgery.

[CFJ 1836 (called 18 December 2007): Ratification of an official
document affects only those aspects of gamestate that are defined to
be part of the official report, and not aspects that are incidentally
reported on; in particular, ratification of an official report on
certain parameters pertaining to each player does not ratify the list
of players.]

[CFJ 2289 (called 25 November 2008): Ratification Without Objection of
a value inseparable from another value may change the latter value
even if it is not directly part of the report being ratified.]

Rule 2201/6 (Power=3)
Self-Ratification

      A public document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is
      ratified when it is continuously undoubted for one week.

      A doubt is an explicit public challenge via one of the following
      methods, identifying a document and explaining the scope and
      nature of a perceived error in it:

       a) An inquiry case, appropriate for questions of legal
          interpretation.

       b) A claim of error, appropriate for matters of fact.  The
          publisher of the original document SHALL (if e was required
          to publish that document) or SHOULD (otherwise) do one of
          the following in a timely fashion:

              i) Deny the claim (causing it to cease to be a doubt).
             ii) Publish a revision.
            iii) Initiate an inquiry case regarding the truth of the
                 claim (if the subject is actually a matter of law),
                 or cite a relevant existing inquiry case.

[CFJ 1690 (called 19 June 2007): A challenge to a self-ratifying
document [at the time of CFJ 1690, the resolution of an Agoran
decision] must explicitly identify the document, either individually
or as part of a set, and explicitly contest the accuracy of some
aspect of it.]

[CFJs 1790-1791 (called 11 November 2007): A challenge to any part of
a self-ratifying document prevents ratification of all parts of it.]

Rule 2446/3 (Power=1)
The Agoran Newspaper

      The Reportor is an office.

      The Reportor's weekly report includes:

         a) A suitable name for a newspaper, at the Reportor's
            discretion.

         b) A description of events that have happened since the last
            report that the Reportor believes significant or
            interesting.

         c) Any editorialization or other pieces of Agora-related
            information the Reportor pleases, as long as it is neither
            i) factually incorrect nor ii) disrespectful to any person
            or Agora itself.

      While meeting these requirements, the Reportor may format eir
      report however e pleases.

      The Reportor should keep in mind that the goal of eir weekly
      report is to create a more informed population.

The Registrar

     The Registrar is an office; its holder is responsible for keeping 
     track of players.

     The Registrar's weekly report includes:

     a) A list of all players, including information sufficient to
        identify and contact each player.

     b) The date on which each player most recently became a player.

     c) For each forum with non-Foreign publicity, sufficient
        instructions for players to receive messages there.

     The Registrar's monthly report includes:

     a) For each former player for which the information is reasonably 
        available, the dates on which e registered and deregistered.

     In the first week of every month the Registrar SHALL attempt to
     deregister every player that has not sent a message to a public
     forum in the preceding month.

     The Registrar's duties and abilities also include:

     * Changing the publicity of a forum, as described in Rule 478.

     * Publishing Cantus Cygnei and Writs of FAGE as described in 
       Rule 1789.

     The Registrar is also responsible for tracking any switches that
     would otherwise lack an officer to track them, unless the switch
     is defined as untracked.

[CFJ 1703 (called 13 July 2007): A player cannot change eir nickname

      b) The time at which each person on Personal Lockout comes off

Rule 2459/2 (Power=1.2)
Organizations

      An Organization is a type of entity. The following changes are
      secured: creating, modifying, or destroying an Organization; and
      causing an entity to become an Organization or cease to be an
      Organization.

      The Income Cap is 100.

      Budget is a switch belonging to (Organization, player) pairs
      (i.e. there is one instance of the switch for each combination
      of an Organization and a player), tracked by the Secretary,
      whose legal values are integers from 0 to the Income Cap 
      inclusive, defaulting to 0. An Organization's Income is the 
      total value of all Budget switches for pairs that include that 
      Organization. A player's Expenditure is the total value of all 
      Budget switches for pairs that include that player. Changes to 
      Budget are secured.

      A "member" of an Organization is a player for which the pair
      consisting of that Organization and that player has a nonzero
      Budget.

      It is IMPOSSIBLE, by any means, for a player to become a member
      of an Organization, or for an organization to be created with a
      player as a member, without that player's explicit, willful
      consent. This rule takes precedence over any rule that might
      make such a change possible.

Rule 2460/0 (Power=1.2)
Organizational Restructuring

      Charter is an Organization switch, tracked by the Secretary in
      eir monthly report, whose legal values are texts, and with
      default value "An amendment to this Organization is Appropriate
      if intent to perform it was announced between 4 and 14 days ago,
      and no members of the Organization have publicly objected to it
      since."

      A change to an instance of a Budget or Charter switch is known
      as an "amendment" to the Organization to which that instance of
      the switch applies. Each amendment to an Organization is
      considered to be either Appropriate or Inappropriate. An
      Organization's Charter SHOULD contain a method of determining
      the appropriateness of amendments to that Organization.

      If a Charter does not specify the appropriateness of an
      amendment to its Organization, or if it attempts to specify the
      appropriateness of such an amendment but in a way that is
      unclear, ambiguous, circular, inconsistent, paradoxical, or that
      depends on information that is impossible or unreasonably
      difficult to determine, the amendment is Inappropriate;
      otherwise, it is Appropriate if and only if the Charter
      specifies that it is.

      Organizations can be amended as follows:

      a) A member of an Organization CAN flip that Organization's
         Charter by announcement, if doing so is Appropriate, and that
         member is not on Lockout.
      b) Any player CAN flip a Budget Switch by announcement, if doing
         so is Appropriate and the player is not on Lockout, except
         where other rules prevent this.
      c) A member of an Organization CAN flip that Organization's
         Charter without objection, even if doing so is Inappropriate,
         as long as that member is not on Lockout. Players SHOULD only
         use this mechanism to recover from situations where the
         Charter is underspecified or has unintended effects.

Rule 2461/2 (Power=1.2)
Death and Birth of Organizations

      The Income Floor is 50.

      If an Organization's Income is ever lower than the Income Floor,
      then any player CAN destroy it by announcement, and the Secretary
      SHALL do so in a timely fashion if the situation persists.

      If a player's Expenditure is at most the Income Cap minus the 
      Income Floor, and e is not on Lockout, then e CAN create an 
      Organization by announcement, specifying a name for that 
      Organization that is unique among Organizations, and a Charter. 
      When an organization is created this way, its Charter is set to 
      the value that e specified, and the Budget switch for that 
      player and Organization is set to the Income Floor.

      Notwithstanding the above, a player CANNOT create more than one
      Organization in a day, and CANNOT create Organizations while e
      is a member of an Organization with an Income lower than the
      Income Floor.

      situation persists.

      When a player becomes Bankrupt:

Rule 2457/0 (Power=1.2)
Lockout

      There is such a thing as a Lockout Event, which can happen
      either to a person or to Agora as a whole. Lockout Events only
      happen when a Rule with power 1 or greater explicitly states
      that they happen.

      A person is on Personal Lockout if a Lockout Event happened to
      that person within the past 90 days.

      Agora is on Global Lockout if a Lockout Event happened to Agora
      as a whole within the past 7 days.

      A person is on Lockout if that person is on Personal Lockout,
      Agora is on Global Lockout, or both. A person is "off Lockout"
      if that person is not on Lockout.

Rule 2438/4 (Power=3)
Ribbons

      The Tailor is an office, and the recordkeepor of Ribbons.

      Ribbon Ownership is a person switch, tracked by the Tailor in
      his monthly report, whose values are the subsets of the set of
      types of Ribbon, defaulting to the empty set.

      To "award a person a <Ribbon type>" is to add that type of
      Ribbon to that person's Ribbon Ownership. A person "owns a
      <Ribbon type>" if that type of Ribbon is an element of eir
      Ribbon Ownership.

      While a person qualifies for a type of Ribbon, any player can
      generally award em that type of Ribbon. A person qualifies for a
      type of Ribbon if e has earned that type of Ribbon within the
      preceding 7 days (including earlier in the same message) and has
      not owned that type of Ribbon within the preceding 7 days.

      While a person owns all types of Ribbon, that person can Raise a
      Banner by announcement. This causes that person to win the game.
      That person's Ribbon Ownership becomes the empty set.

      The types of Ribbon, and the methods of obtaining them, are as
      follows:

      Red (R): When a proposal is adopted and changes at least one
      rule with Power >= 3, its proposer earns a Red Ribbon.

      Orange (O): When a proposal is adopted via an Agoran Decision on
      which no valid votes were AGAINST, its proposer earns an Orange
      Ribbon.

      Green (G): While a person has held an elected office
      continuously for 30 days, and has not failed to perform any
      duties of that office within the appropriate time limits during
      those 30 days, that person qualifies for a Green Ribbon.

      Cyan (C): When a person deputises for an office, that person
      earns a Cyan Ribbon.

      Blue (B): When a person assigns a judgement to a CFJ, and has
      never violated a time limit to assign a judgement to that CFJ,
      that person earns a Blue Ribbon.

      Magenta (M): During Agora's Birthday, each person who has

Rule 2444/2 (Power=1)
Silver Quill

      The Silver Quill is an annual award designed to honor the
      authors of proposals of outstanding merit and influence on the
      game.

      In a timely fashion after the end of each Agoran Year, the 
      Herald SHALL initiate and Agoran Decision to determine which 
      Proposal has most greatly influenced that (ending) year of play.

      For this decision, the valid options are all proposals adopted
      between November 1 of the year prior to the ending year, and
      October 31 of the ending year.  The vote collector is the
      Herald, and the voting method is instant runoff.

      Players are ENCOURAGED to discuss which eligible proposals best
      satisfy the aforementioned criteria.  Proposals submitted by new
      players SHOULD be given somewhat higher weight, but the primary
      reference should be the proposals themselves and their effect on
      the game since adoption.

      Upon the resolution of the decision, if the outcome is not
      FAILED QUORUM and there were at least three votes containing it
      in any preference slot, that proposal wins the Ceremony, and the
      Herald is authorized to award its author the Patent Title of
      "Silver Quill YYYY, substituting the ending year; otherwise,
      there is no winner.

Rule 2464/0 (Power=1)
Tournaments

      A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned
      to be initiated as a tournament by the Rules.  If a winner of a
      tournament is determined within 4 weeks of its initiation, that
      person or persons win the game, otherwise the tournament
      concludes with no winner.

      In a timely fashion after the start of June 1 of each year,
      the Herald SHALL propose a set of Regulations governing a
      Birthday Tournament for that year; the Herald CAN also
      delegate the responsibility for creating or running the
      tournament to another player, with that player's consent.

      The Birthday Tournament's regulations SHOULD be such that all
      persons who choose to participate have a fair chance of winning
      the tournament (according to its regulations), and a winner
      SHOULD be expected within 2-3 weeks following the tournament's
      initiation.

      After adequate time for discussion of the Birthday Tournament's
      regulations, the Herald (or delegate) CAN initiate a sanctioned
      tournament with a specified, finalized set of regulations, 
      Without 3 Objections.  The initiation SHOULD be timed to 
      coincide with Agora's Birthday.

Rule 649/37 (Power=1.5)
Patent Titles

      A Patent Title is a legal title given to a person in recognition
      of the person's distinction.  The Herald is an office; its
      holder is responsible for tracking Patent Titles in eir monthly
      report.

      Awarding or revoking a Patent Title is secured.  A person
      permitted and enabled to award (revoke) a Patent Title SHALL do
      so in a timely fashion after the conditions authorizing em to do
      so are announced, unless there is an open judicial case
      contesting the validity of those conditions.

      The Herald CAN award a specified Patent Title to a specified
      player With 2 Agoran Consent.

[CFJ 1525 (called 15 November 2004): If a patent title is defined by
the rules, and previously the rules defined a patent title with the
same spelling but a different award condition, the two are the same
patent title.]

[CFJ 1592 (called 1 December 2006): A patent title, once borne, is
borne until explicitly revoked, even if the rule defining the patent
title is repealed or the patent title was never defined by a rule.]

[CFJ 1731 (called 23 August 2007): It is possible for an entity [a
person at the time of CFJ 1731] to bear more than one instance of a
patent title simultaneously.]

[CFJ 1591 (called 1 December 2006): Where a person bears the patent
title X, and X is not also defined by the rules to have some special
meaning, it is correct to say that that person "is an X".]

Rule 1367/19 (Power=3)
Degrees

      Certain patent titles are known as degrees.  The degrees are

      - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
      - Bachelor of Nomic                  (B.N.)

      - Doctor of Nomic History            (D.N.Hist.)
      - Doctor of Nomic Science            (D.N.Sci.)
      - Doctor of Nomic Philosophy         (D.N.Phil.)

      Degrees are ranked in the order they appear in this rule, with
      degrees listed later being ranked higher.  A specific degree
      CANNOT be awarded to any person more than once.

      A specified degree CAN be awarded with 2 Agoran Consent, and
      SHOULD only be awarded for the publication of an original
      thesis of scholarly worth (including responses to peer-review),
      published with explicit intent to qualify for a degree.  The
      Herald SHOULD coordinate the peer-review process and the
      awarding of degrees.

Rule 2231/5 (Power=3)
Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic

      Heroic titles are Agora's premier patent titles of distinction,
      and CAN be awarded to persons for meritorious service only by a
      proposal of power 3 or greater, which SHOULD explain why those
      persons are qualified.  Bearers of heroic titles (Heroes)
      constitute the Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic.

      The Heroic titles in decreasing precedence are:

      Grand Hero of Agora Nomic (GHAN) -- This title may be awarded to
      any person obviously and directly responsible for the existence
      of Agora and/or Nomic in general.  As this title is the highest
      honour that Agora may bestow, a Bearer of this title OUGHT to be
      treated right good forever.

      Hero of Agora Nomic (HAN) -- This title may be awarded to any
      person for outstanding meritorious service to Agora above and
      beyond the call of duty.

Rule 1727/18 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by FIRST SPEAKER
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

          "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
          precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we
          may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are
          invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
          published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
          convenience."

      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
      on, until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICIAL NAME of
      Agora,

      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
      and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard
      work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,

      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year.

Contracts / Binding Agreements

[CFJ 1892 (called 2 February 2008): An agreement that is not binding
is thereby not a contract.]

[CFJ 1901 (called 4 February 2008): An agreement that is binding is
thereby a contract, even if it doesn't impose any obligations.]

[CFJ 1892 (called 2 February 2008): An agreement's text can disclaim
contract/binding status, thereby nullifying itself, by explicitly
describing itself as a non-contract or as non-binding.]

[CFJ 1872 (called 15 January 2008): Being a player is not a
prerequisite for becoming party to a contract.]

[CFJ 1796 (called 14 November 2007): If a person announces that e
agrees to be bound by a particular text as a contract, without saying
who this agreement is with, and the contract text does not regulate
who can become a party to it, then any person can become a party to
the contract by announcement.]

[CFJ 1455 (called 14 March 2003): A contract cannot cause an
otherwise-insignificant action by a non-party to constitute consent to
be bound by the contract.]

[CFJ 1856 (called 29 December 2007): A contract is null and void if
the courts do not have sufficient evidence that a person's
contract-related rights (in Rule 101) are not being infringed.  This
includes evidence that the party to the contract has reviewed the
rules and has direct prior knowledge of the fora.]

[CFJ 1686 (called 7 June 2007): A person who is not a party to an
agreement categorically cannot violate it.]

[CFJ 1752 (called 28 September 2007): Deregistration does not
implicitly cause the ex-player to leave a contract.]

[CFJ 1842 (called 20 December 2007): A contract may use retroactive
operations internally for the purposes of determining obligations of
the parties, but such legal fictions do not affect Agora as a whole.]

[CFJ 1836 (called 18 December 2007): A contract cannot have
retroactive effect.]

[CFJ 1843 (called 20 December 2007): Becoming a party to a contract
cannot occur retroactively, for the purposes of determining
justiciability of the contract.]

[CFJ 1816 (called 2 December 2007): A contract is not generally able
to define terms used by the rules.]

[CFJ 1819 (called 3 December 2007): A contract is not able to create
new ways of winning the game.]

[CFJ 1835 (called 18 December 2007): An authorisation granted by a
party in a contract takes precedence over a unilateral statement by
that party that purports to cancel that authorisation.]

[CFJ 1921 (called 2 April 2008): Agreements with informal phrasing can
be considered contracts, but only when made in a medium where lying is
against the Rules (i.e. a public forum).]

[CFJ 2302 (called 7 December 2008): The scope of the text of a
contract is limited compared to that of a rule; in particular, a
contract cannot cause a paradox by setting undecidable conditions on
joining it.]

[CFJ 2101 (called 20 July 2008): Consent to join a binding agreement
implies consent to join later agreements created through currently
existing rule-defined processes.]

[CFJ 2220 (called 11 October 2008): Consent to join a binding
agreement may be an effect of another action, such as joining a
foreign nomic, as long as the action is triggered by free will and the
actor is reasonably aware of the effect.]

[CFJ 2246 (called 30 October 2008): Joining a contract does not imply
consent to be acted on behalf of simply because the contract might be
amended in the future to allow it.]

[CFJ 2264 (called 11 November 2008): The right to refuse to become
party to an agreement does not apply to amendments to existing
agreements.]

[CFJ 2410 (called 11 March 2009): Consent to join a binding agreement
may be given privately.]

[CFJ 2761 (called 7 February 2010): The termination of a contract
through processes it explicitly envisions (including a rule-defined
mechanism, if the contract is intended to be governed under Agoran
law) is akin to a natural death, and does not generally constitute a
restriction of its rights as a person.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Truthfulness

[CFJ 1739 (called 29 August 2007): A quotation can result in a
violation of Rule 2215 (then 2149), depending on the context of the
rest of the message.]

[CFJ 1849 (called 21 December 2007): Violation of Rule 2215 (then
2149) can occur without any intent to misdirect.]

[CFJ 1887 (called 30 January 2008): Publicly making the statement
"This statement is a lie." would most likely be a violation of rule
2215 (then 2149), because it is logically indeterminate and so making
it would not be telling the truth, and its logical indeterminacy would
be understood by any reasonable player.]

Miscellaneous

[CFJ 2276a (called 20 November 2008): When a rule allows, as an
action, a quantity to be increased which is defined elsewhere as a
fixed value, and that action is taken, the rule thereby redefines the
quantity as one more than it would otherwise be.]

[CFJ 1856 (called 29 December 2007): The requirement that "no
interpretation of Agoran law may abridge ... a person's defined
rights" means that it must be feasible, given the practical limits of

defined rights are not being limited.]

[CFJ 2361 (called 26 January 2009): The withholding of a reward for
